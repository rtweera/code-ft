To create an Ollama model from your fine-tuned Qwen 2.5B Coder model using the files you’ve provided in the `ollama-finetuned-qwen` directory, you’ll need to convert these files into a format compatible with Ollama, specifically GGUF (a quantized model format commonly used with tools like `llama.cpp` and supported by Ollama). The files you’ve listed appear to be in a Hugging Face Transformers format (e.g., `.safetensors`, `tokenizer.json`, etc.), which is typical after fine-tuning with frameworks like PyTorch or Hugging Face’s `transformers` library. However, Ollama requires a GGUF file and a `Modelfile` to define the model’s behavior.

Here’s a step-by-step guide to create an Ollama model from your fine-tuned files:

---

### Step 1: Verify the Files
The files you’ve provided include:
- `adapter_config.json` and `adapter_model.safetensors`: These suggest you’ve fine-tuned the model using LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) or a similar technique, which only modifies a subset of weights rather than the full model.
- `model.safetensors`: A large file (1.9 GB) that might be the base model weights or a partial set of fine-tuned weights.
- Tokenizer-related files (`tokenizer.json`, `vocab.json`, `merges.txt`, etc.): These define the tokenizer, which is necessary for text preprocessing.
- Configuration files (`config.json`, `generation_config.json`, etc.): These specify the model architecture and generation parameters.

**Are these sufficient?**
- If `model.safetensors` contains the full fine-tuned model weights (not just adapters), you have enough to proceed.
- If it only contains adapter weights (e.g., from LoRA fine-tuning), you’ll need the base Qwen 2.5B model weights as well (typically multi-gigabyte files like `pytorch_model.bin` or additional `.safetensors` files from the original Qwen 2.5B model). Since the Qwen 2.5B model is around 2.5 billion parameters, the base weights should be larger than 1.9 GB (closer to 5-10 GB depending on quantization), so it’s likely you’re missing the full base model weights.

For now, I’ll assume you have or can obtain the base Qwen 2.5B model weights from its official source (e.g., Hugging Face: `Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct` or similar, though you mentioned 2.5B, which doesn’t exist—perhaps you meant 1.5B or 3B?). If you only have adapter weights, you’ll need to merge them with the base model first.

---

### Step 2: Merge Adapter Weights (if applicable)
If your fine-tuning used LoRA or adapters, you need to merge the adapter weights (`adapter_model.safetensors`) with the base model weights. Here’s how:

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install transformers torch peft
   ```

2. **Merge the Weights**:
   Use a Python script to combine the base model and adapter weights. Replace `BASE_MODEL_PATH` with the path to the original Qwen 2.5B model (download it from Hugging Face if needed).

   ```python
   from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
   from peft import PeftModel

   # Paths
   base_model_path = "Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct"  # Adjust to the correct base model
   adapter_path = "ollama-finetuned-qwen"
   output_path = "merged-qwen2.5-finetuned"

   # Load base model and tokenizer
   model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(base_model_path)
   tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(base_model_path)

   # Load and apply the adapter
   model = PeftModel.from_pretrained(model, adapter_path)
   model = model.merge_and_unload()  # Merge adapter into base model

   # Save the merged model
   model.save_pretrained(output_path)
   tokenizer.save_pretrained(output_path)
   ```

   This will create a new directory (`merged-qwen2.5-finetuned`) with the full merged weights.

   **Note**: If `model.safetensors` is already the full fine-tuned model (not an adapter), skip this step and use your existing directory directly.

---

### Step 3: Convert to GGUF Format
Ollama uses GGUF files, so you need to convert your `.safetensors` or `.bin` files to GGUF using `llama.cpp`.

1. **Install llama.cpp**:
   Clone the repository and build it:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp.git
   cd llama.cpp
   make
   ```

2. **Convert the Model**:
   Use the `convert-hf-to-gguf.py` script from `llama.cpp`. If you merged the model, point to that directory; otherwise, use your original directory.

   ```bash
   python convert-hf-to-gguf.py merged-qwen2.5-finetuned --outfile qwen2.5-finetuned.gguf
   ```

   This generates `qwen2.5-finetuned.gguf`, a single file containing the model weights in GGUF format.

---

### Step 4: Create a Modelfile for Ollama
Ollama requires a `Modelfile` to define the model’s properties. Create a file named `Modelfile` in your working directory with the following content:

```plaintext
FROM ./qwen2.5-finetuned.gguf

# Set parameters (adjust as needed)
PARAMETER temperature 0.7
PARAMETER top_p 0.8
PARAMETER repeat_penalty 1.05
PARAMETER top_k 20

# Define the chat template (based on Qwen2.5’s typical format)
TEMPLATE """
{{- if .Messages }}
{{- if or .System .Tools }}<|im_start|>system {{ .System }}<|im_end|> {{ end }}
{{- range $i, $_ := .Messages }}
{{- $last := eq (len (slice $.Messages $i)) 1 }}
{{- if eq .Role "user" }}<|im_start|>user {{ .Content }}<|im_end|> {{ else if eq .Role "assistant" }}<|im_start|>assistant {{ .Content }}{{ if not $last }}<|im_end|> {{ end }}
{{- end }}
{{- if and (ne .Role "assistant") $last }}<|im_start|>assistant {{ end }}
{{- end }}
{{- else }}
{{- if .System }}<|im_start|>system {{ .System }}<|im_end|> {{ end }}
{{ if .Prompt }}<|im_start|>user {{ .Prompt }}<|im_end|> {{ end }}
<|im_start|>assistant
{{ end }}
{{ .Response }}{{ if .Response }}<|im_end>{{ end }}
"""

# System prompt
SYSTEM "You are a fine-tuned Qwen 2.5 Coder model, created by xAI. You are a helpful coding assistant."
```

- Adjust the `FROM` path to wherever your GGUF file is located.
- The `TEMPLATE` is based on Qwen2.5’s chat format; tweak it if your fine-tuning changed the expected input/output style.

---

### Step 5: Create and Run the Ollama Model
1. **Install Ollama** (if not already installed):
   Follow the instructions at [ollama.com](https://ollama.com) for your platform.

2. **Create the Model**:
   Run this command in the directory containing your `Modelfile` and `qwen2.5-finetuned.gguf`:
   ```bash
   ollama create qwen2.5-finetuned -f Modelfile
   ```

3. **Test the Model**:
   Start the model and interact with it:
   ```bash
   ollama run qwen2.5-finetuned
   ```
   Type a prompt (e.g., “Write a Python function to sort a list”) and see if it responds as expected.

---

### Troubleshooting and Notes
- **Missing Base Model**: If your `model.safetensors` is incomplete or only contains adapters, download the base Qwen 2.5 model from Hugging Face (e.g., `Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct` or `Qwen/Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct`) and merge it as shown in Step 2.
- **Size Check**: The Qwen 2.5B model doesn’t exist—Qwen2.5 comes in sizes like 0.5B, 1.5B, 3B, 7B, etc. If you meant 1.5B or 3B, ensure your base model matches the fine-tuning target.
- **Quantization**: The GGUF file created in Step 3 is unquantized. For better performance on limited hardware, quantize it using `llama.cpp`’s `quantize` tool (e.g., to Q4_K_M):
  ```bash
  ./quantize qwen2.5-finetuned.gguf qwen2.5-finetuned-q4.gguf Q4_K_M
  ```
  Update the `Modelfile`’s `FROM` line to point to the quantized file.

---

### Conclusion
Your files are likely sufficient if `model.safetensors` contains the full fine-tuned weights. If it’s just an adapter, you’ll need the base model weights too. Once merged and converted to GGUF, the process to create an Ollama model is straightforward. Let me know if you hit any snags or need clarification!
